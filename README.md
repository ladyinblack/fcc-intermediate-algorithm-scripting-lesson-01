### [Sum All Numbers in a Range](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
You need to create a program that will take an array of two numbers who are not necessarily in order, and then add not just those numbers but any numbers in between.  For example, [3, 1] will be the same as `1+2+3` and not just `3+1`.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
Use `Math.max()` to find the maximum value of two numbers.

### Hint 2
Use `Math.min()` to find the minimum value of two numbers.

### Hint 3
Remember that you must add all the numbers in between so this would require a way to get those numbers.
